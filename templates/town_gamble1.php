Gambling can be a quick way to gain easy money, but it can also break you, leaving you as nothing more than a pitiful shell of wretched human filth. But hey, that won't happen to you, will it? You're a lucky guy, right? Right?<br /><br />Select a cup, enter a bet amount, and click the button to see if you win.<br /><br />
<a href=\"index.php?do=gamble&mode=easy\">Easy gambling</a> gives 2-to-1 payouts. <a href=\"index.php?do=gamble&mode=hard\">Hard gambling</a> gives 10-to-1 payouts, but it's a lot harder to win.<br /><br />
<form action=\"index.php?do=gamble&mode={{mode}}\" method=\"post\">

Bet amount: <input type=\"text\" name=\"amount\" size=\"5\" maxlength=\"10\" /><br /><br />

</form>
